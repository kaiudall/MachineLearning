# MachineLearning

This repository contains machine learning projects that I have worked on personally as well as in groups, through my time studying at Utah State University.

1. [Big Data Group Project on Ames Housing Data Set](https://github.com/kaiudall/MachineLearning/blob/master/xgboost_tune_turnin.R) 

A group project involving Neil Rasmussen, Joshua Young, and myself. We analyzed [Ames Housing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), used techniques such as LASSO, Random Forests, and Gradient boosting to determine an appropriate model for predicting housing prices, and imputed the data using the MICE package in R to help with issues of missingness
